    is_finite_horizon: bool = False
    """Whether the learning task is treated as a finite or infinite horizon problem for the agent.
    Defaults to False, which means the task is treated as an infinite horizon problem.

    This flag handles the subtleties of finite and infinite horizon tasks:

    * **Finite horizon**: no penalty or bootstrapping value is required by the the agent for
      running out of time. However, the environment still needs to terminate the episode after the
      time limit is reached.
    * **Infinite horizon**: the agent needs to bootstrap the value of the state at the end of the episode.
      This is done by sending a time-limit (or truncated) done signal to the agent, which triggers this
      bootstrapping calculation.

    If True, then the environment is treated as a finite horizon problem and no time-out (or truncated) done signal
    is sent to the agent. If False, then the environment is treated as an infinite horizon problem and a time-out
    (or truncated) done signal is sent to the agent.

    Note:
        The base :class:`ManagerBasedRLEnv` class does not use this flag directly. It is used by the environment
        wrappers to determine what type of done signal to send to the corresponding learning agent.
